The lexDAO Token Accreditation Program (TAP) streamlines attorney certifications for accreditation status with private online questionnaires integrated with a public whitelist registry for Reg. D token sales represented by non-transferrable, [non-fungible tokens (ERC-721)](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721).

# Legal Base

The "Accredited investor" verification rules of Reg. D 506(c) allow attorneys to certify accreditation and maintain investor privacy while also allowing issuers to comply with their obligation to take *reasonable steps* to verify the status of purchasers of their securities. 

# Code Base

lexDAO on [Aragon](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/lexdao/home/) controls on-chain attorney registrations for this certification role.  

Currently, authorized lexDAO attorneys can use this [OpenLaw form](https://lib.openlaw.io/web/default/template/accredited%20investor%20token%20certification) to cerfify your accreditation status and allow you to legibly participate in regulated token sales that might otherwise be deemed securities under U.S. federal law.
